						While Netflix began as a movie rental service, it gave it's customers much more time with the product than DIVX did. It also rented regular DVD's, meaning consumers did not have to purchase an expensive DIVX player. Additionally, the Netflix business model would later update with the advent of streaming infrastructure and forego the entire rental business model, which DIVX could have done, although such a pivot would be unlikely considering the investment in the rental encryption technology at the time. It would also have to lower it's rates to match Netflix's, which would also be a financial burden that DIVX arguably could not afford.

					<aside class="notes">
					If DIVX were to win the format war over DVD's, we might not have seen the rise of streaming technology and the subscription service business model (at least not like how it is implemented today). If this anti consumer platform was proven to be more financially viable than the more consumer friendly approaches taken by Spotify and Netflix, more companies would be pressured into delivering DRM locked content, which would mean more spending on the consumers part to access content for an extended period of time. I believe it would also slow down the advancement of technology overall, similar to how gas powered cars have created a market that is so full of money that electric cars/ more effective and efficient technology is actively shot down in order to keep the old moneymaking paradigm going.

				<aside class="notes">
						The policies, business model, and rhetoric that DIVX employed was not only hostile towards conventional DVD's (labelling their own arguably inferior catalog as "DIVX Enhanced" vs "Basic DVD's"), they were also very anti consumer in nature. Consumers were given less features and an altered final product of the film with a large portion of screen space missing for a slightly cheaper cost than conventional DVD's. The consumer was also forced to go through the DIVX company itself if they wanted to extend the time that they had access to a movie, meaning they had to call DIVX, log into their profile and be charged a fee for a 2 day extension. This was both tedius and a process that had quickly diminishing returns vs. purchasing a regular DVD.

						If DIVX had succeeded, however, I believe they would've had a similar presence to RedBox, which has physical drop off and pick up spots that users can access at any time. They allow for fast and cheap access to the media (DVD's, Blu Rays, and Games) and can be found in a lot of high traffic locations. I believe DIVX "boxes" would operate similarly, however without the ability to rent games and the short default rental period, I could see this ultimately failing when competing directly with RedBox, especially due to their wider overall catalog that featured many bonus feautures cut from DIVX ports.

						Ultimately, DIVX failed because of the creators attempts to force consumers to use their platform, which was more restricted than thet market leader at the time (DVD's) and offered less value for the consumer. The freedom of choice is something that can be found in all major media delivery platforms (YouTube, Netflix, PlayStation Store, Steam etc.) and is crucial in terms of attracting and retaining new customers. Beyond this, the reliance on an overpriced player when most people had already invested in regular DVD players really limited their reachable audience. Finally, altering the video aspect ratio and removing extra features that consumers would easily get elsewhere made the choice to skip DIVX an easy one for many.
